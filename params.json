{"name":"The state of airline websites 2015","tagline":"中文对照","body":"## The State Of Airline Websites 2015: Lessons Learned\r\n\r\n-   By Joshua Johnson\r\n-   November 10th, 2015\r\n-   Performance UX\r\n\r\n*With this article, we start exploring various industries and study the\r\n**current state of front-end, UX and performance** of relatively complex\r\nwebsites. First up are airline websites. Some sections of the article\r\nwere written by the editorial team. We’d love to hear your flights\r\nbooking experience in the comments to this article! — Ed.*\r\n\r\nFrom my home in Phoenix, Arizona, the entire world is only a few clicks\r\naway. I’ve booked flights to St. Louis, San Francisco, Honolulu, New\r\nYork, London, Melbourne, Entebbe and beyond. Sometimes I’ll land in one\r\nlocation, travel around and leave from another. Sometimes I’ll switch or\r\ncancel a flight, and sometimes the weather does that for me. Regardless,\r\nI always get to where I want to go, and fantastic technology is in place\r\nto help me every step of the way.\r\n\r\nAll of this tends to be so easy that I take it for granted. But let’s\r\nthink about this process from a designer’s perspective. Taking such a\r\ndiverse system of possible actions and turning them into a\r\nuser-friendly, self-serve experience is a **pretty complex challenge**.\r\nAny experienced traveler will tell you that some companies do it better\r\nthan others. To find out, let’s take a closer look at a few airline\r\nwebsites from around the world.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we’ll discover the critical steps of booking air travel\r\nand how they’re presented by different companies.\r\n\r\n### The Airlines\r\n\r\n开始前，我们先选择15家评价较高的航空公司，取全球排行前五名：\r\n[评价最高的航空公司](http://www.worldairlineawards.com/awards/world_airline_rating.html)\r\n\r\n-   [卡塔尔航空](http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/homepage.page)\r\n-   [新加坡航空](http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/us/home)\r\n-   [国泰航空](http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_US.html)\r\n-   [土耳其航空](http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/)\r\n-   [阿联酋航空](http://www.emirates.com/us/english/)\r\n\r\n然后补以如下10家航司：\r\n\r\n-   [维珍美国](https://www.virginamerica.com) (responsive)\r\n-   [汉莎航空](http://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage)\r\n-   [瑞安航空](http://www.ryanair.com) (responsive)\r\n-   [新西兰航空](http://www.airnewzealand.com)\r\n-   [挪威航空](http://beta.norwegian.com/) (responsive)\r\n-   [达美航空](http://www.delta.com)\r\n-   [瑞士航空](https://www.swiss.com) (responsive)\r\n-   [荷兰皇家航空](http://www.klm.com) (responsive)\r\n-   [阿斯塔纳航空](http://airastana.com/) (responsive)\r\n\r\n### 研究范围限制\r\n\r\n在一片文章中深入对比15个网站是不现实的，所以我们将缩小比较方向：首页，布局，预订流程和性能。\r\n\r\nObviously, a deep dive into 15 websites is far too much to cover in a\r\nsingle post. So, we’ll limit ourselves to certain areas: each website’s\r\nhome page **layout, booking process and performance**. That’ll give us a\r\ngood introduction to how each airline’s website operates. Also note that\r\nmost of these websites have several localized versions. For the sake of\r\nsanity, we’ll stick to the English versions.\r\n\r\nFair warning: Objectivity is awesome, but any design critique you’ll\r\never read is chock-full of subjective observations. This one is no\r\ndifferent. That being said, I welcome friendly disagreement and\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n### 首页\r\n\r\nTo begin, let’s briefly look at the home pages of each of these\r\nwebsites. This is the first place most potential customers will land\r\nwhen looking to book a flight, so it’s absolutely critical. After even\r\ntwo or three seconds on a website’s home page, you’ll find that you form\r\nqualitative opinions about the company that are difficult to ignore.\r\n\r\n#### 设计目标\r\n\r\nAs we analyze these designs, we should always think about what the goals\r\nof the page are. Here are some truly **base-level goals** that I think\r\nall airline home pages share:\r\n\r\n-   Convey the company’s brand and identity.\r\n-   Inspire and educate curious potential travelers to make a purchase.\r\n-   Direct customers looking to make a purchase to the correct user flow\r\n    (and/or answer their questions).\r\n-   Direct customers who have already made a purchase to the information\r\n    or actions they need (checking in, checking flight status, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe websites we’ll be looking at were designed by professionals. All of\r\nthem are fairly attractive and easy to use. So, when we talk about\r\nstrengths and weaknesses, it’s really only relative to the other\r\nwebsites on this list.\r\n\r\n#### 留白 vs. 效率\r\n\r\nIn comparing all websites, [Turkish\r\nAirlines](http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/) is the one that stands\r\nout as the **most cluttered**. The design very tightly clumps all of the\r\nvarious elements, without allowing for much breathing room. In the\r\nvisual hierarchy, instead of a clear path, we find a lot of evenly\r\nweighted items competing for our attention (the busy background pattern\r\ndoesn’t help). Instead of naturally finding a logical progression, my\r\neyes bounce around, looking at all of the separate little UI elements.\r\nIt takes quite a bit of effort to fully explore the page.\r\n\r\n[Qatar Airways](http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/homepage.page)\r\n(ranked number one worldwide) suffers from these same issues but to a\r\nlesser degree. Its design is a bit more airy, with sections that are a\r\nlittle more visually distinct.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-1-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-1-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe upside of these designs is that they are quite efficient. Some of\r\nthe other home pages look and feel much cleaner, but the design takes up\r\na ton more room and requires a **great deal of scrolling** as a result.\r\nFor example, [Cathay\r\nPacific](http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_US.html)’s home page is\r\nlonger than Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways’ combined!\r\n[Emirates](http://www.emirates.com/us/english/) isn’t quite as long as\r\nCathay, but ranks a close second.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-2-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-2-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nMoving along, [Lufthansa](http://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage) has\r\none of the more visually appealing pages, with its big, beautiful\r\nphotos, and it’s another long scroller. By comparison, [Air New\r\nZealand](http://www.airnewzealand.com/)’s is super-short, and Singapore\r\nAirlines’ falls somewhere in between.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-4-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-4-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nFinally, [Delta](http://www.delta.com/), [Virgin\r\nAmerica](https://www.virginamerica.com/) and\r\n[Ryanair](http://www.ryanair.com/) all fall in the mid-range. All have\r\nplenty of information, options and white space on the home page, while\r\nminimizing the scrolling necessary to get through it all. On contrary,\r\nminimalistic designs by [SWISS](https://www.swiss.com) and [Norwegian\r\nAirlines](http://beta.norwegian.com/) do seem as appealing as the ones\r\nwith heavy imagery.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/airlines-3-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-3-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nAesthetically, I can’t help but feel that the most attractive pages here\r\n(Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific, etc.) take the longest to scroll through,\r\nunfortunately. Similarly, as mentioned, the shorter pages tend to be\r\nless attractive.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/minimalism-airlines-opt-preview.png)](images/minimalism-airlines-opt.png)\r\n\r\nSWISS, Norwegian Airlines and RyanAir seem to have the simplest designs.\r\n\r\n**Design is about tradeoffs**. Every seemingly simple decision, such as\r\nremoving or adding white space, affects the overall experience. Of\r\ncourse we don’t know whether the airlines websites ran A/B tests on\r\nwhether users find it easy to use the site, but the airlines websites\r\nwith more white space *did* feel easier to work through. Always predict\r\nthe effects that your decisions will have on end users, and then test\r\nthose assumptions post-launch.\r\n\r\n### Promoting Airline Quality Vs. Wanderlust\r\n\r\nAnother interesting tradeoff I see in these designs speaks directly to\r\ntwo of the goals outlined earlier:\r\n\r\n-   Convey the company’s brand and identity.\r\n-   Inspire and educate curious potential travelers to make a purchase.\r\n\r\nBoth the imagery and copy on these websites tend to tackle only one of\r\nthese goals at a time. Below, all three of the images, pulled from\r\nSingapore Airlines and Lufthansa, **primarily promote the airlines\r\nthemselves**, rather than particular destinations. We all know that long\r\nflights can be incredibly uncomfortable, so the primary message here is\r\nthat these airlines have your comfort as a top priority. Also, notice\r\nthat two of the three promise added comfort through a more expensive\r\nticket.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-5-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-5-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nContrast the technique here with the one exhibited in the images below.\r\nHere, it’s not about the airline itself, but about what flying\r\nrepresents — a way to **escape to exciting and exotic locations**:\r\nAustralia, Cancun, Zanzibar.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-6-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-6-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nSome of the airlines focus on one of these strategies, while others try\r\nto juggle both, typically through the use of sliders that cycle through\r\nseveral messages and photos. This raises an important question. Are\r\nthese sliders effective? Can these airlines effectively promote both\r\ntheir brand and their destinations by cycling through different sales\r\npitches?\r\n\r\n#### 处处轮播广告\r\n\r\nAlmost every website in our list uses **at least one image slider**.\r\nSome use several. Singapore Airlines uses *three* sliders on the home\r\npage alone (four, if you count the small rotating news feed). In fact,\r\nsliders seem to be a logical and attractive way to fit a ton of content\r\nin a small space. However, as it turns out, some faulty assumptions\r\nmight be at play here — namely, that a typical user will pay attention\r\nto, wait for and/or interact with a slider. Yet in many cases, sliders\r\ncan actually cost you conversions. A quick search of studies and\r\ndiscussions on sliders reveals\r\n[quite](http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/)\r\n[a\r\nbit](http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496)\r\n[of](http://marketingland.com/rotating-banners-image-sliders-kill-conversions-89984)\r\n[animosity](https://yoast.com/opinion-on-sliders/) towards this\r\nparticular UI element.\r\n\r\nNotice the strong language in the titles of these articles. Some\r\ndesigners are not only abandoning sliders, but viciously attacking them,\r\ntoo. That being said, we can’t assume that this sentiment is universal.\r\nJust because some people have found that their own sliders have reduced\r\nconversions doesn’t necessarily mean that all sliders on all websites\r\nare bad. Some UX professionals advocate not for killing sliders\r\naltogether, but rather for [optimizing their\r\ndesign](http://uxmovement.com/navigation/why-users-arent-clicking-your-home-page-carousel/)\r\nfor [better\r\nresults](http://www.jacksonwynne.com/image-slideshow-alternatives/).\r\n\r\nOne slider that clearly needs some work is Delta’s:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-14-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-14-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nRegardless of the viewport’s width, the photos in these sliders are\r\nbrutally murdered by CSS. They’re being squished instead of cropped, an\r\neffect that’s exaggerated when you see the original images before the\r\nCSS takes hold:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-15-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-15-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is a clear case of a slider being poorly executed. However, we\r\ncan’t accuse all sliders of having these same problems. A simple way to\r\nmake a slider more usable is to **provide context to users** — for\r\nexample, thumbnails and text that explain what each item in the slider\r\nstands for. Sliders could also be made responsive, showing more items\r\nprominently when enough space is available and fewer items otherwise.\r\n\r\nAirlines seem to depend on this particular UI element quite heavily,\r\nwhich makes all of the sliders look very similar, almost generic. I’d\r\nargue that the airlines might be well served by exploring and testing\r\nalternatives, such as an **accordion or tabbed widget**.\r\n\r\n#### 次要任务\r\n\r\nNow that we’ve made some sweeping macro-level observations about these\r\npages, let’s dive to the micro level. Referring to our goals above, we\r\nsee that visitors to these home pages often need to accomplish a number\r\nof secondary tasks (the purchase flow being the primary directive):\r\n**checking in**, checking their flight status, etc. Most of the websites\r\nare similar in how they handle these tasks, but a few interesting\r\ndetails are worth noting.\r\n\r\nThe winner in this category is [Virgin\r\nAmerica](https://www.virginamerica.com/). Rather than bombarding you\r\nwith a million options, the home page is amazingly simple. One of the\r\nfirst items on the page distills almost all of the visitor’s major tasks\r\ninto three simple categories: “Book,” “Check in” and “Manage.”\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-7-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-7-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nEven if we zoom out and consider the entire navigation menu, it’s\r\nsurprisingly concise. The visual hierarchy is straightforward, too.\r\nNotice how the designers have used bolded text and all caps as well as\r\nsubtle vertical dividers to differentiate the sections.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-8-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-8-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nContrast this with Emirates’ experience, which has **both vertical and\r\nhorizontal navigation**. However, the information all blends together.\r\nThe page doesn’t have many more links than Virgin’s, but the lack of\r\ndifferentiation and hierarchy makes it feel much more difficult to sift\r\nthrough. Quick skimming is not a possibility here. I feel like I have to\r\nslowly and deliberately read each item to find what I’m looking for.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-9-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-9-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nOne link that I always find myself hunting for on any airline website is\r\nthe one for **checking in**. It’s a key step when you have an upcoming\r\nflight, and it should be easy to find on any airline website. As we saw\r\nabove, it’s pretty prominent on Virgin America’s home page. In fact,\r\nmost of the websites in our list prioritize it in the header.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-10-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-10-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all websites make it so easy. Let’s see Lufthansa’s\r\nheader.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-11-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-11-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nGiven up yet? You should have, because the link for checking in is\r\nnowhere to be found in the top 600 pixels of the home page. It’s way\r\ndown, below that big graphic:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-12-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-12-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo be fair, this area is dedicated almost entirely to checking in, and\r\nit is also very clean and attractive. As much as I appreciate the design\r\nof this section on its own, though, my instinct was to hunt for this\r\ninformation at the top of the page, and not being able to find it **was\r\npretty frustrating**.\r\n\r\nIt’s quite unlikely that Lufthansa’s user data shows that this is the\r\nbest spot for the check-in widget. Or maybe that’s just where the\r\ndesigners stuck it because it looked good in the layout. Nevertheless,\r\nchecking in doesn’t seem to be prioritized for the user, and unless you\r\ntravel with Lufthansa a lot, it is difficult to spot. One can imagine\r\nthat many travellers, once disappointed, would query “Lufthansa\r\ncheck-in” in a **search engine** instead — not a good experience.\r\n\r\nIt holds true everywhere: as designers, our job is to simply\r\n**prioritize important actions** and display them prominently. Never\r\nhide them behind an icon or button. Make them visible and easily\r\naccessible on desktop, tablet and mobile. Prioritize user needs, not\r\ncompany’s branding.\r\n\r\nYour list of priorities might be huge and difficult to rank, and that’s\r\nexactly what designers of airline home pages face. One place to look for\r\nhelp is competing websites; you could identify common problems with user\r\nflow and start designing a better experience for precisely those\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nEverybody wants to be better than their competitors, so address these\r\nissues head on. You could go as far as **creating a spreadsheet with the\r\nmost critical tasks and constraints**: How could you add a bit of\r\ndelight to the experience or reduce complexity? If you’re building a\r\nresponsive website, look into the content itself in its purest form,\r\nexamine it and **repackage it** to best suit the challenges of different\r\nform factors.\r\n\r\nIf you present pricing options for flights in a table on the desktop,\r\nyou don’t necessarily have to keep it as a table on tablets and phones;\r\nit could be a set of accordions with data lists, for example. A seating\r\nplan on the desktop could be transformed into a UI that first offers\r\ngeneral seating options and, based on the user’s selection, provides a\r\nsimplified seating map with zooming functionality and a supporting data\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile Experience\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of airlines websites is mobile strategy. In\r\nthis data set, we have a sort of microcosm for how the Internet as a\r\nwhole handles mobile users in 2015: A few websites have gone fully\r\nresponsive, even more reroute users to a dedicated mobile website, and\r\nstill others do absolutely nothing. ~~Fortunately, at the time of\r\nwriting only one airline, Ryanair, leaves mobile users out completely\r\n(depending on the user’s IP address, though — it seems to be rolling out\r\na new responsive website now).~~\r\n\r\nHere are the airlines with a **responsive** website:\r\n\r\n-   [Singapore Airlines](http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/us/home)\r\n-   [Cathay Pacific Airways](http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_US.html)\r\n-   [Virgin America](https://www.virginamerica.com)\r\n-   [Lufthansa](http://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage)\r\n    (kind-of-responsive)\r\n-   [SWISS](https://www.swiss.com)\r\n-   [KLM](http://www.klm.com)\r\n-   [Air Astana](http://airastana.com/)\r\n-   [Norwegian Airlines](http://beta.norwegian.com/)\r\n-   [Ryanair](http://www.ryanair.com)\r\n\r\nHere are the airlines with a **dedicated mobile** website:\r\n\r\n-   [Qatar Airways](http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/homepage.page)\r\n-   [Lufthansa](http://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage) (which has both\r\n    a mobile website and a responsive desktop website)\r\n-   [Turkish Airlines](http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-us/)\r\n-   [Air New Zealand](http://www.airnewzealand.com)\r\n-   [Delta](http://www.delta.com)\r\n-   [Emirates](http://www.emirates.com/us/english/)\r\n\r\n### Flight-Booking Process\r\n\r\nNow we get to the good stuff: booking a flight. Every airline on our\r\nlist agrees on one thing: that this process should start right on the\r\nhome page. That’s where the agreement ends, though. From here on out,\r\nit’s a battle of ideas and UX strategies.\r\n\r\nLet’s focus on some of the major pain points that we encountered with\r\nsome airlines and how these are solved or addressed by others.\r\n\r\n#### Too Much Or Too Little\r\n\r\nThe flight-booking widgets across the home pages vary dramatically in\r\ncomplexity. Typically, you’ll see something like Singapore Airlines’\r\nwidget:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-19-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-19-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the user has a good bit of work to do here. They have to\r\nchoose their cities, type of flight, dates, seating class and so on, all\r\nfrom the home page before hitting the search button. Now contrast this\r\nwidget with Virgin’s:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-18-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-18-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is that both airlines have to collect the same\r\ninformation. Singapore Airlines chooses to do it all in one place, which\r\ncan be daunting but convenient. Virgin opts to **draw out the process**,\r\npushing a lot of the work to later screens, but it feels more guided.\r\n\r\nOverall, I like Virgin’s approach. The copywriting is friendly, and the\r\nsimple interface makes me feel like the process is going to be easy.\r\nRemember that not every user books a flight and travels the globe\r\nregularly. For many, flying is quite a stressful experience. As\r\ndesigners, we have a great opportunity and even an obligation to reduce\r\nthe stress associated with complex activities by making UIs that are\r\nsimple, intentional and friendly.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Virgin’s widget is so simple that it might be\r\nfrustrating. For instance, every other website lets users type to filter\r\ntheir destination. Virgin forces you to scroll through a list of results\r\nand manually click where you want to go. (**Update**: This has either\r\nbeen fixed or I totally missed that you can type in a destination in my\r\nearlier review. Either way, it works great now.)\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-20-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-20-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nQatar Airways is similarly limited but in exactly the opposite way. It\r\nhas no dropdown menu for users to choose from at all. Instead, users are\r\nforced to type in the destination.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-24-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-24-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Revealed Complexity\r\n\r\nA smart technique for dealing with a complex process is to make the\r\nfirst step as simple as possible and then slowly reveal more as the user\r\nworks through the steps.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/progressive-disclosure-1-opt-preview.png)](images/progressive-disclosure-1-opt.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Ryanair’s home page widget is both attractive and\r\nsimple. Once the user enters their destination, another step is\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/progressive-disclosure-2-opt-preview.png)](images/progressive-disclosure-2-opt.png)\r\n\r\nIf this happened more than once, it’d be frustrating, but I found the\r\ninteraction to be friendly enough the way it’s implemented.\r\n\r\nA similar approach makes Virgin’s widget, which we saw earlier, seem\r\nsimpler than it actually is. The guest controls are hidden in a fairly\r\nunconventional but easy-to-use dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-23-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-23-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Date-Picker Dilemmas\r\n\r\nProviding a way for users to pick dates for a flight seems pretty\r\nstraightforward, but here’s an interesting question: How many months\r\nshould you show in the date-picker?\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-25-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-25-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-26-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-26-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-27-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-27-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome airlines show one month at a time, most show two, and Qatar throws\r\ncaution to the wind, showing a huge widget that lets users view three\r\nmonths at a time.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find that **three months feels excessive** and takes up\r\nway too much space for a modal (it blocks half the page). One month is\r\nfine, but two months is the sweet spot. Context is important: I’d wager\r\nthat the vast majority of round-trip flights aren’t longer than a month,\r\nso a two-month view should be more than sufficient, while minimizing\r\nside-scrolling.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/pickers-500px.jpg)](images/pickers.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### In Search of Low Fares\r\n\r\nChoosing a date is one of the main areas of frustration for me when\r\nbooking a flight. Like many travellers, I’m **flexible with my\r\nschedule** because I know that leaving a day earlier or later than\r\nplanned can save me hundreds of dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen forced to choose a firm date in one of those booking widgets, I\r\nworry that I won’t be given the chance to see a calendar of fares and\r\nthat I’ll be stuck with my selection, instead of being able to shuffle\r\nmy dates.\r\n\r\nAirlines deal with this pain point in different ways. Delta allows users\r\nto choose between “Exact dates” and “Flexible days” (although the\r\nwording there is inconsistent).\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-31-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-31-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nNext, though, they show this **crazy, mutant date-picker** that has both\r\na horizontal and vertical axis, allowing users to choose their departure\r\nand return dates in one go. In fact, this component is consistently used\r\npretty much everywhere to display outbound and inbound flights along two\r\naxis, with prices along both dimensions. The matrix can get quite\r\ncomplex and overwhelming, especially if it contains more than 7 days on\r\neach axis.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-32-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-32-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe whole double-axis thing is interesting, but in practice, I needed a\r\nfew seconds to figure out just what the heck I was looking at.\r\n\r\nAir New Zealand implements its own version of this same idea to help\r\nusers find a low fare:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-29-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-29-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nPutting the vertical-axis titles on the right side and not rotating the\r\ntext makes Air New Zealand’s fare finder easier to figure out, but I’m\r\nstill not convinced this piece of UI is user-friendly.\r\n\r\nInstead of using a matrix, International shows a nice overview of\r\noptions, with corresponding prices, reducing the number of options to\r\nfour days. Norwegian Airlines shows prices for five days, and Cathay\r\nPacific, Singapore Airlines, Delta Airlines and Turkish Airlines show\r\nfor seven days. Air Astana provides a complicated comparison table, with\r\nhuge images as well as filtering and ordering options, which make the\r\ninterface quite difficult to use. Air New Zealand doesn’t have a matrix\r\nat all; instead, it lets users choose a day to focus on (along with a\r\ncorresponding price) and then shows all of the options for that day.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/calendars-500px.jpg)](images/calendars.jpg)\r\n\r\nI wonder whether an **alternate view of an accordion** with flight\r\noptions sorted by price would make the interface slightly less complex\r\nand the experience slightly more enjoyable. The user could then choose\r\nthe view they prefer. In fact, the dual-view approach could work in many\r\nscenarios — for example, when data could be presented as a graph or as a\r\ntable, or when an overview of products could be presented in a\r\nthumbnail-grid view or as a data list.\r\n\r\n#### “Don’t Make Me Repeat Steps”\r\n\r\nOne frustrating thing that Air New Zealand does (as well as others) is\r\nforce users to choose a date in the home page widget and then push them\r\ninto the calendar fare view, where they have to choose again. I\r\nappreciate the effort in helping me find a low price, but if you’re\r\ngoing to take me to the low-fare calendar anyway, why make me choose a\r\ndate on the home page? Wouldn’t it be better to ask me for the month or\r\nweek when I’ll be travelling instead, or guide me to the low-fare\r\ncalendar only if I explicitly choose to do so?\r\n\r\nVirgin’s simpler process wins again here by making users choose dates\r\nonly once, and doing it on a page that lets them compare fares.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-28-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-28-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Actions That Aren’t Actions\r\n\r\nAnother surprisingly frustrating action is **choosing an actual\r\nflight**. Seems like it should be easy, right? Not always. Take the\r\nflight schedule from Singapore Airlines below. First, I don’t find the\r\nplane/no-plane icon system to be intuitive, but let’s ignore that for\r\nnow. Let’s also ignore the lack of prices in this list. Instead, let’s\r\nconsider that you can’t actually select any of the flights in this\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-33-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-33-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead, you have to memorize which flight you want, then click “Book\r\nNow,” and then start the booking process over with the widget on the\r\nhome page. It seems downright ludicrous to me that this is the process,\r\nbut that’s how it works.\r\n\r\nVirgin makes a less serious but similarly confusing mistake. It presents\r\nfare options in rows, and each row is highlighted when you hover over\r\nit, which makes you think you can click it — but you can’t.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-34-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-34-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nInstead, you **have to click on one of the little three squares**. This\r\nmakes for a confusing experience in which you try to select a flight,\r\nclick around, realize you’re doing it wrong, and then hunt around for\r\nthe right solution. To me, a hover effect almost always implies that a\r\nclick event is possible. This could be reworked so that a click on a row\r\ndoes make a selection, which would refocus your attention by\r\nhighlighting the price boxes, or so that a click on a row selects one of\r\nthe options (probably the cheapest).\r\n\r\nA final example of click frustration is shown below in Lufthansa’s\r\nwidget:\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-35-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-35-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis little chart is a bit confusing. To make it worse, all of those\r\nvague little icons look like clickable buttons, but they’re not; they\r\nsimply indicate the status of various options.\r\n\r\n### Checkout Flow: From Start to Finish\r\n\r\nThe essence of an airline website’s experience is to enable customers to\r\npurchase tickets seamlessly. Well, at least that’s what one would\r\nexpect. In reality, the checkout experience is often anything but\r\nstraightforward or seamless. Many things can (and do) go wrong, leaving\r\ncustomers in the dark, forcing them to figure out an interface or\r\ncompare flight options. Admittedly, checkout experiences in general can\r\nget quite complex, so getting it right isn’t exactly easy.\r\n\r\nThis complexity is evident in the **amount of effort required** from the\r\nuser to complete their purchase. Most airlines have between five and\r\nseven steps in their checkout process — the travel dates are followed by\r\nthe flight selection, followed by upsells, followed by the seat\r\nselection, followed by payment, followed by the confirmation screen.\r\nObviously, keeping the user actively involved throughout the process is\r\ncritical; so, many airlines highlight the selected flight and price by\r\n**fixing them either in the sidebar or at the top** of the page — always\r\nwithin view.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/seat-quality.jpg)](images/seat-quality.jpg)\r\n\r\nSometimes, the booking experience is quite frustrating from the very\r\nfirst step. Most airlines force you to select an airport to fly from,\r\nnot just a city. Selecting a multi-city route is often difficult because\r\nthe system assumes that you want to return to the city that you departed\r\nfrom. Selecting more than two multi-city flights is often simply\r\nimpossible. For whatever reason, the lowest fare is usually highlighted\r\nwith a tiny triangle in the upper-left or upper-right corner of the\r\nflight option — whereas highlighting the entire option instead might be\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/seats-500px.jpg)](images/seats.jpg)\r\n\r\nAirlines often distinguish between low-fare calendars and normal\r\nsearches for flights, which assumes that users must **explicitly search\r\nfor low-fares** when booking a flight. On Singapore Airlines’ website,\r\none can choose between “View schedules” and “Search” for flights. The\r\ninterface for selecting a seat is usually annoyingly small; icons that\r\nare used remarkably often are just as often unclickable; and users often\r\nhave to verify their email address by retyping it (of course, most of us\r\nwill just copy and paste our address, making this verification quite\r\nuseless). KLM tries to motivate visitors to make a quick purchase by\r\nshowing how many customers have just bought a similar flight or are\r\nlooking at the option right now.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, most airlines allow users to check out as a guest by\r\ndefault; as mentioned above, airport inputs usually have autocompletion;\r\na currency converter is provided more often than one might expect; and\r\nsometimes you can even save a trip for future reference (Ryanair’s\r\n“wishlist”), “hold a flight” for a couple of days (Air New Zealand),\r\nautomate your check-in (SWISS sends a boarding pass automatically 20\r\nhours before departure) or even see the price in airlines miles (Delta).\r\n\r\nAll airlines have a good **old-fashioned payment form with 5–7 input\r\nfields**. Not a single airline, though, uses the [single-field\r\ncredit-card input\r\npattern](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/single-field-credit-card-input-pattern/);\r\ncustomers are usually required to select their credit-card type first\r\nand then input their digits. Testing transactions is a bit beyond the\r\nscope of this article (and our financial allowance, too, by the way).\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPerformance matters, and it affects conversions. However, finding a fast\r\nairline website — whether responsive or not — proved to be quite\r\ndifficult. In most cases, airline websites load Modernizr, jQuery, a\r\njQuery plugin for carousels, custom web fonts and a tracking script such\r\nas Omniture, Optimizely, OpenTag or uTag. All of these scripts together,\r\nwith an A/B testing application running in the head of the page, make\r\n**most of the websites quite slow**. In fact, none of the reviewed\r\nwebsites have a start-rendering time below 1.8 seconds, even with\r\noptimal connectivity conditions, an average PageSpeed score is 50.5 on\r\nmobile and 63.4 on desktop, and none of the websites support HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nAirline websites with better performance did turn out to be responsive.\r\nThe fastest, though, [proved to be New Zealand\r\nAirlines](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151102_XY_18P1/)’s old\r\nnon-responsive website, with a start-rendering time of 1.79 seconds.\r\n\r\nIn terms of HTTP requests, the home page for [Norwegian\r\nAirlines](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151102_RP_18P9/) turned out\r\nto be the leanest (and are probably the newest), with 42 HTTP requests\r\nand weighing in at 1.1 MB. The design is well crafted, yet too many\r\nscripts block the rendering of the pages. Norwegian Airlines uses\r\nAngularJS. Performance is way better on subsequent loads, though.\r\nNorwegian Airlines’ CSS runs 15,610 lines long; both follow the BEM\r\nmethodology.\r\n\r\nResponsive doesn’t necessarily mean fast. Air Astana’s home page,\r\nweighing in at 4.1 MB, is responsive yet only [starts rendering after 7\r\nseconds](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151102_8S_18PH/); Bootstrap,\r\njQuery, jQuery UI, three different theme skins and Telerik’s web UI have\r\nbeen crammed into the head of the page. KLM’s responsive home page [is\r\nfaster](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151102_HM_T53/) ~~and [scores\r\nthe highest on\r\nPageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.klm.com%2F&tab=desktop)~~,\r\nbut it loads a `blank.gif` file that is 365 bytes yet causes 569\r\nmilliseconds in latency.\r\n[Lufthansa](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151102_GQ_18NV/) is again\r\nslightly better, yet it requires jQuery, Dojo and uTag.\r\n\r\n[![PageSpeed\r\nScores](images/pagespeed-scores-opt-preview.png)](images/pagespeed-scores-opt.png)\\\r\n\r\n[Norwegian\r\nAirlines](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbeta.norwegian.com%2F&tab=mobile)\r\nscores the highest on Page Speed, followed by\r\n[Delta](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.delta.com%2F&tab=mobile)\r\nand [Qatar\r\nAirways](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fglobal%2Fen%2Fhomepage.page&tab=mobile)\r\n(both 64 on mobile). One shouldn’t make a mistake of comparing a\r\nlanguage splash page (KLM, on the left) with an actual airline website\r\n(Norwegian, on the right). KLM doesn’t score as high on its internal\r\npages. \r\n\r\nApart from Air Astana, another performance offender is\r\n[Emirates](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151102_E5_18NJ/), with its\r\n306 HTTP requests and 151 KB (Gzipped) of JavaScript\r\n(`controls-main.js`), although it starts rendering within 2.4 seconds!\r\nAlso, Ryanair’s new responsive home page, with its whopping [Speed Index\r\nof 21,745](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151106_C4_AN3/), makes 89\r\nHTTP requests and has a start-rendering time of 9.5 seconds on a cable\r\nconnection. Ryanair makes heavy use of AngularJS and also loads a number\r\nof JavaScripts in the head synchronously, blocking rendering of the\r\nwebsite. As discovered by Ben Schwarz, the reason for that is a plethora\r\nof [expensive\r\nselectors](https://medium.com/performance-snapshot/performance-snapshot-ryanair-s-2015-redesign-dbd508c78a33)\r\nbeing used — after all, the CSS file is 2.88Mb in size ungzipped.\r\n\r\n[](images/ryanair-js-opt.png) [![](images/ryanair-js-opt.png)\\\r\n](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151106_C4_AN3/)\r\n\r\n[](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151106_C4_AN3/)[Ryanair’s\r\nWebPagetest result](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151106_C4_AN3/):\r\nThat’s a lot of blocking JavaScript.\r\n\r\nOn average, the home pages of airline websites are around 1.94 MB. The\r\ncode is usually quite up to date, yet every now and again you’ll find\r\nlegacy scripts and techniques used. For example, Emirates still uses\r\nCufón to deliver web fonts, with text embedded in images, and Lufthansa\r\nstill uses Flash for checking in and selecting seats.\r\n\r\n### Lessons Learned\r\n\r\nIf you’ve never worked on an airline website, then hopefully this\r\narticle will help you appreciate the scale of the work, even if it just\r\nscratches the surface of the complexity involved. From predicting\r\nhundreds, even thousands, of user actions to deciding what to promote in\r\na limited amount of space, and even figuring out how many months to show\r\nin a date-picker, a lot of design decisions need to be made.\r\n\r\n#### Frustrations\r\n\r\nAll of these airline websites get the job done, but we discovered plenty\r\nof minor and major frustrations:\r\n\r\n-   Home page clutter overwhelms users with options.\r\n-   To avoid clutter, too many airlines over-rely on sliders, which\r\n    either hide important information or are clunky.\r\n-   Multiple navigation menus on a single page can look crammed and flow\r\n    in different directions, competing with each other visually.\r\n-   Complex multi-matrix flight-booking widgets make the process of\r\n    selecting a flight intimidating.\r\n-   Redundant actions force users either to make choices they’re not\r\n    ready to make or to repeat selections they’ve already made.\r\n-   The UI for comparing flight prices is often weird and unexpected.\r\n-   Users are often forced to play a guessing game about what’s\r\n    clickable.\r\n-   Low-fare calendars often appear at the wrong time and cause\r\n    confusion, largely due to design.\r\n-   During check-in, typing in passport and visa information is often\r\n    very cumbersome. Smart defaults would go a long way. For example,\r\n    birth date input fields and select menus are often set on the\r\n    current date and, hence, require a lot of annoying scrolling.\r\n-   After check-in, many airlines don’t provide enough information about\r\n    the terminal, luggage restrictions and airplane.\r\n-   Multi-city flights are typically impossible to book or just broken.\r\n    Trips are often assumed to be either one way or return. And if you\r\n    book a multi-city trip, you are expected to return to the city you\r\n    departed from.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot](images/zurich-flight-behind-500px-opt.png)](images/zurich-flight-behind-opt.png)\r\n\r\nSWISS prompts a little pop-up if they assume that you are about to\r\nabandon the purchase. \r\n\r\n#### Responses\r\n\r\nIn addressing these complaints, we can derive some important lessons on\r\ndesigning projects of this scale:\r\n\r\n-   Sliders might feel like a great way to manage clutter, but they are\r\n    often a complete failure in interaction. If you’re putting critical\r\n    information two or three slides in, odds are that many users will\r\n    never see it. Never hide important content.\r\n-   The answer to problems of information architecture isn’t to add a\r\n    bunch of navigation menus. Prioritize and put the important content\r\n    up front, throughout the different form factors.\r\n-   Obvious but worth pointing out: in addition to keeping menus lean,\r\n    consider visually differentiating them to establish a clear\r\n    hierarchy, instead of having 15 identically styled links.\r\n-   For lengthy processes, consider gradually revealing complexity as\r\n    users progress, rather than overwhelming them up front.\r\n-   Always be aware of which items are indicated as being clickable.\r\n    Nothing confuses users quicker than not being able to figure out\r\n    where to click.\r\n-   Instead of showing a complex, mutant date-picker matrix, provide an\r\n    overview of options for 4 days and highlight the lowest fares\r\n    prominently (or even as a default selection).\r\n-   Handy features such as airport input autocomplete, wishlist, flight\r\n    reservation, automated check-in or currency converter help make the\r\n    experience more delightful.\r\n-   By prioritizing performance and providing a smooth UX, you can\r\n    outperform competitors by a long shot — mostly because most airlines\r\n    websites out there are quite slow and the experience is quite\r\n    frustrating.\r\n\r\n### Break Down The Complexity\r\n\r\nOverall, airline websites are so completely inundated with information,\r\noptions, possible user flows, instructions and sales pitches that I\r\nfound any website that simply cleared out the mess and gave me some\r\nspace to be a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nThis is a primary reason why Virgin received more attention throughout\r\nthis article than almost any other airline. Overall, its website just\r\nfelt better. The design was clean and attractive, the copy was friendly,\r\nand I was guided through the steps without much extra thought or\r\nfrustration.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](images/airlines-36-opt-preview.jpg)](images/airlines-36-opt.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou need only look at the image above to get a feel for what it’s like\r\nto book a flight with Virgin. When you get to selecting a seat, the\r\noccupied areas are adorned with silly faces. Most airlines take\r\nthemselves far too seriously to ever consider this delightful little\r\ndesign quirk, which makes it that much more fun and refreshing.\r\n\r\nWebsites that try the hardest to think of and provide everything a user\r\nmight need are often the ones that fail the most in meeting our desires\r\nand expectations. Those rare websites that cut away all the bloat and\r\nleave us with a limited but solid core experience are the ones we\r\nremember and come back to again and again. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?\r\nWell, it remains to be seen how airline websites will evolve —\r\nhopefully, towards leaner, faster and more delightful experiences.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
